## 🔧 Customization

### Adding New Exercises
Edit `src/pages/ExercisePage.tsx` to add more practice questions:

```typescript
const exercises: Exercise[] = [
  // Add your new exercise here
  {
    id: 6,
    type: 'multiple-choice',
    question: "Your question here",
    content: "Text to analyze",
    options: ["Option 1", "Option 2", "Option 3"],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: "Why this answer is correct",
    difficulty: 'easy'
  }
]
```

### Modifying Sentiment Analysis
Update the algorithm in `src/context/SentimentContext.tsx`:

```typescript
// Add new emotion words
const positiveWords = [
  // ... existing words
  'your-new-positive-word'
]

const negativeWords = [
  // ... existing words
  'your-new-negative-word'
]
```
